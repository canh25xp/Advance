Given an integer `N`.
Find number of possible ways to represent `N` as a sum of at most 5 cubes.

## Input

First line contains N (`1 <= N <= 125000`)

```
4
1
64
905
15436
```

## Output

Output the result

```
#1 1
#2 2
#3 0
#4 12
```

## explanation:

For the second test case:
- First way: 64 = 27 + 27 + 8 + 1 + 1
- 2nd way: 64 = 64 + 0  + 0 + 0 + 0
